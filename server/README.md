# Server (placeholder)

This folder will contain server-side code (game world, authoritative tick loop, networking handlers).

Suggested layout (to implement later):
- `src/` — server source files
- `tests/` — server unit/integration tests
- `config/` — server config (port, tick rate)

Do not implement code in this placeholder.
