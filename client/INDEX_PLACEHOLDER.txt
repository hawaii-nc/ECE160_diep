NOTE: This project now targets a Python/pygame local client instead of a browser-based HTML client.

Remove or ignore HTML placeholders. Intended client files (pygame):

- `client/main.py`  — main pygame entrypoint (see `client/main_placeholder.py` for responsibilities)
- `client/game/`    — game modules (world, entities, projectiles, ai, renderer)
- `assets/images/`  — sprites and icons
- `assets/sounds/`  — sound effects and music

Do not add implementation code here yet. Use the placeholders and docs in `docs/` when ready to implement.
