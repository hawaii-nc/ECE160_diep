# PLACEHOLDER: `main.py` (pygame entry point)
#
# Purpose (no implementation here):
# - Initialize pygame and window/screen
# - Run the main game loop (fixed or variable timestep)
# - Create and manage game world, entities, projectiles
# - Run simple AI/bot manager that spawns and updates bots locally
# - Handle input (keyboard/mouse) and map to player actions
# - Render world and HUD
#
# When implementing later, keep responsibilities small and modular:
# - game/__init__.py or game/core.py for world & tick loop
# - game/renderer.py for drawing
# - game/input.py for input mapping
# - game/ai.py for bot behaviours
# - assets/ for images/sounds
#
# This file intentionally contains no runnable code. Replace with a small entrypoint when ready.
